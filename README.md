## Task

We have been tasked to create a web app that should work similar to Facebook. Users are be able to create their own accounts, log in to them, log out of them, be able to create posts, like posts and comment on any posts that they want. They will also have a Profile Page which they are able to edit.\

- [Nadia](https://github.com/NBenzineb)

Technologies used:

- [Trello](https://trello.com/b/wlp4ENq8/acebook-zark-muckerberg) for planning.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework for Node.js.
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to reload the server automatically.
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to render view templates.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) to model objects in MongoDB.
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) for hosting our database.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for linting.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing.

## Instructions

Clone this repository to your desired location using `git clone https://github.com/jmcnally17/acebook-zark-muckerberg.git`.\
\
Make sure you have the most recent update of Node and then you can run `npm install` whilst in the main directory in your terminal to install dependencies.\
\
You can run tests by using the command `npm run start:test` to load up the test server then using `npm test` to run all the test files.\
\
You will need to have mongoDB to be able to run this web app in it's intended manner, you can run the commands `brew tap mongodb/brew` and then `brew install mongodb-community@5.0` in order to install mongoDB.\
\
In order to access for the website to function, you will need to run the server on localhost by using `npm start` and then going on `localhost:3000` to access the website. From there, you will be able to make an account and those account details will then be stored on your local database.\
\
If you wish to clear the database, use the command `mongo` while in the terminal, you can then use the command `use acebook` (or `use acebook_test` for the test database) to access the database. You can then use the commands `db.users.drop()` to clear the users, `db.posts.drop()` to clear the posts and `db.comments.drop()` to clear the comments. You can do the same for the test database although those get cleared before running your tests so they are relatively small.\
